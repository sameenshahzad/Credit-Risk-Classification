# Credit-Risk-Classification

## Background
In this challenge, I used various techniques to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. I used a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers

The analysis was performed in the following subsections:

* Split the Data into Training and Testing Sets
* Create a Logistic Regression Model with the Original Data
* Predict a Logistic Regression Model with Resampled Training Data


## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to use Machine Learning to analyze a dataset of historical lending activity from a peer-to-peer lending services company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers

Under this analysis, we will predict which loans are healthy (low-risk) or non-healthy (high-risk) based on the loan status provided by the lending company.

Taking a look at the data, I first split the data into Training and Testing Sets.

Then using the value_counts fuction, I was able to identify that the data was highly imbalanced; more Healthy Loans [0] and less non-Healthy Loans [1]



* Explain the purpose of the analysis.
* Explain what financial information the data was on, and what you needed to predict.
* Provide basic information about the variables you were trying to predict (e.g., `value_counts`).
* Describe the stages of the machine learning process you went through as part of this analysis.
* Briefly touch on any methods you used (e.g., `LogisticRegression`, or any resampling method).

## Results

Using bulleted lists, describe the balanced accuracy scores and the precision and recall scores of all machine learning models.

* Machine Learning Model 1:
  * Description of Model 1 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.



* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.

## Summary

Summarize the results of the machine learning models, and include a recommendation on the model to use, if any. For example:
* Which one seems to perform best? How do you know it performs best?
* Does performance depend on the problem we are trying to solve? (For example, is it more important to predict the `1`'s, or predict the `0`'s? )

If you do not recommend any of the models, please justify your reasoning.
